# [Datagov-wp-boilerplate]

WordPress boilerplate based on [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock)

Bedrock is a modern WordPress stack that helps you get started with the best development tools and project structure.

Much of the philosophy behind Bedrock is inspired by the [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/) methodology including the [WordPress specific version](https://roots.io/twelve-factor-wordpress/).

## Updating WP and plugin versions

Updating your WordPress version (or any plugin) is just a matter of changing the version number in the `composer.json` file.

Then running `composer update` will pull down the new version.
